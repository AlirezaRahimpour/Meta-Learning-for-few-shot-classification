WACV2020: Class-Discriminative Feature Embedding For Meta-Learning based Few-Shot Classification

Although deep learning-based approaches have been very effective in solving problems with plenty of labeled
data, they suffer in tackling problems for which labeled data
are scarce. In few-shot classification, the objective is to
train a classifier from only a handful of labeled examples
in a support set. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning framework based on structured margin loss which takes
into account the global structure of the support set in order to generate a highly discriminative feature space where
the features from distinct classes are well separated in clusters. Moreover, in our meta-learning-based framework, we
propose a context-aware query embedding encoder for incorporating support set context into query embedding and
generating more discriminative and task-dependent query
embeddings. The task-dependent features help the meta learner to learn a distribution over tasks more effectively.
Extensive experiments based on few-shot, zero-shot, and
semi-supervised learning on three benchmarks show the advantages of the proposed model compared to state-of-the art.

The main contributions of this work are as follows:

-  Regularizing the few-shot classification setting with a
structured-based margin loss which takes into account
the global structure of the support set feature space and
learns to explicitly reduce the intra-class variation in
order to map the data to a highly discriminative feature
space where the few-shot classification is most effective.

- Proposing a context-aware query embedding module
which takes into account the support setâ€™s context
and generates task-dependent feature representations
which would help the meta-learner to learn a distribution over tasks more effectively.

-  Performing extensive experiments based on few-shot, one-shot, zero-shot, and semi-supervised learning
schemes to show the advantages of the proposed model
compared to the state-of-the-art.
